# Click-through-rate-prediction

This is a mini Kaggle Competition held in the course of Machine Learning for Financail Engineering & Operation Research at Columbia University. Our solution won the 4th place out of 47 teams. The dataset was slightly modified from the click-through rate prediction contest by Avazu.

### The process we took in this project:
  1. EDA and run simple models on the top 20,000 rows
  2. Feature Engineering and Data Preprocessing
  3. Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning
